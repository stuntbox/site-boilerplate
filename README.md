Basic Website Boilerplate
===========

A set of simple website starter files, using [Bourbon](http://bourbon.io)-flavored [Sass](http://sass-lang.com) and [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com). Requires [node.js](http://nodejs.org).

## Getting Started
- Copy this project to a new directory and rename as needed.
- Go to your new project directory in the command line, and enter the following to install dependencies:  
```
bundle install && npm install
```
- Then enter the following to run it:
```
bundle exec grunt
```
- Thatâ€™s it. This will run Sass, lint, minify and concatenate your JS, fire up a simple webserver at localhost:4000, and watch your project directory for changes.
